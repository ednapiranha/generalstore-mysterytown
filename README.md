# General Store

## What it is

A 2D adventure / interactive fiction game maker.

## Installation

You want to use generalstore to create a game? Here's what you need
to do:

1. Install [node](http://nodejs.org)
2. Clone the repository

   > git clone -b production git://github.com/ednapiranha/generalstore.git

   > cd generalstore

   > npm install


## Writing stories

### Setting up game dimensions

> cd generalstore/config

Edit the `width` and `height` values in defaults.json.

If you don't want level descriptions to display in the game, set `showDescription` to false.


### Running the app

To run the app for game development, do:

> node app.js


### A note about assets

Character and item images can have any file extension (jpg, png, gif) as long as you specify it in your stories/*.txt files.

The only limitation is that inventory assets must have a png extension.


### Setting up stories

> cd stories

Edit stories in a text editor with the following format:

    level
    1

    location
    A crazy party hut

    background_image
    partyhut.jpg

    audio
    meow.ogg

    description
    This is the party hut!

    character
    name: partybear
    image: partybear.png
    left: 100
    top: 400
    requires: false
    gives: mango
    first_says: Hey there, here is a mango!
    finally_says: I already gave you a mango!
    audio: false

    item
    name: car
    image: car.gif
    left: 500
    top: 400
    requires: mango
    gives: gas
    audio: beep.wav
    levels_up_to: 2

All character and item level and name properties are used to generate a unique id. E.g. A level 1 character with the name 'bunny' generates a unique id of 1-bunny.

Every story file starts with:

* level - The level that this file represents. You can only have one unique level per file.
* location - The location name of the level
* background_image - The image used in the level's main background. If this is a png or gif, replace the extension.
* audio - An optional looping audio sample that plays once the level is loaded; write 'false' if you don't want any audio.
* description - An optional description of the location; write 'false' as the content if you want it to be empty. You can also configure generalstore/config/defaults.json to never show descriptions.

Story files can contain zero or more characters and items.

**character**

Contains the properties for each character. All properties are mandatory.

* name - Name of the character.
* image - Filename of the character image. Save the file in `generalstore/media/images/characters/`.
* left - Position of the character from the left. Set your game dimensions in generalstore/config/defaults.json
* top - Position of the character from the top.
* requires - If an inventory object is needed to be given to the character before an initial interaction is triggered, enter it here. Otherwise, write 'false'.
* gives - This is what the character gives to the player after initial interaction. If nothing needs to be given, write 'false'.
* first_says - This is what the character first says to the player on initial interaction.
* finally_says - This is what the character says on subsequent interactions.
* audio - An optional per-click play of an audio sample; write 'false' if you don't want any audio.

**item**

Contains the properties for each item. All properties are mandatory.

* name - Name of the item. The level and name generate a uniqud id and this will dobule as your item's image filename.
* image - Filename of the item image. Save the file in `generalstore/media/images/items/`.
* left - Position of the item from the left.
* top - Position of the item from the top.
* requires - If an inventory object is needed to trigger an item's response (especially if there is a `gives` or `levels_up_to` set), enter it here. Otherwise, write 'false'.
* gives - This is what the item provides the player either on initial interaction or if `requires` is fulfilled.
* audio - An optional per-click play of an audio sample; write 'false' if you don't want any audio.
* levels_up_to - If `requires` is fulfilled for the item, the scene will change to the level set here. Otheriwse, write 'false'.


### Generating files

Once you've completed your txt files, run [http://localhost:3000/generate](http://localhost:3000/generate) in your browser to regenerate the configuration.


## Packaging it up to play!

Ready to deploy as a finished standalone package? Then do:

1. Minify files with Grunt

   > node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt

You only need the contents within generalstore/generalstore (e.g. config/, media/, templates/, main.html).

Copy these files in the generalstore subdirectory to the root of your website and set main.html as the default landing page.
